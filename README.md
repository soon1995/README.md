Hi there :wave: I am Soon!

I'm an enthusiastic back-end developer from Malaysia, living in beautiful Kuala Lumpur
Being a self-driven, career-minded individual, I strive to grow as a developer everyday.

- :star2: I'm interested in discovery new things! New knowledge attracts me!
- ðŸ’° I'm currently working on Golang project, Golang Simplicity impressed me and I am in love with it! I was a Java Self-Learner before.
- :books: I'm currently studying Bachelor Degree in Information Technology. 
- :sweat_drops: I'm looking ways to improve myself so that I am able to make some contribution in open source society.
- :star_struck: Fun fact: I entered IT field at 27, It is quite late, I was a Quantity Surveyor in Construction field and find myself more towards engineering. But why IT? As it is the most possibility to enter without a certificate. However, It is one of the best move in my life as I am enjoying what I am doing now! :cartwheeling:
