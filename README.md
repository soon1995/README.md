![hello](header.png)

Hi there :wave: I am Soon!

I'm a passionate back-end developer hailing from Malaysia and currently residing in the beautiful city of Kuala Lumpur. 
As a self-motivated and career-oriented individual, I am dedicated to continual growth in my role as a developer.

Here are a few things about me:

:star2: I have an insatiable curiosity and a penchant for discovering new knowledge.

💰 Currently, I'm engaged in a Golang project, and I'm truly impressed by Golang's simplicity – it has captured my heart! Previously, I was a self-learner in Java.

:books: I am presently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology.

:sweat_drops: I'm actively seeking ways to enhance my skills and knowledge to contribute to the open-source community.

:star_struck: Fun fact: I ventured into the realm of IT at the age of 27, which some might consider late. Prior to that, I worked as a Quantity Surveyor in the Construction field. However, my passion for engineering led me to IT. Why IT? It was a field I could enter without formal certification, and it turned out to be one of the best decisions I've ever made. I now thoroughly enjoy what I do! :cartwheeling:
